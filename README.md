# password_genrator

A basic password generator script built using Python and loops. It allows users to create strong and secure passwords by combining uppercase letters,, digits, and special characters.

📌 Features
Generates random and secure passwords
Customizable password length
Uses loops and Python's built-in libraries (random, string)
Easy to run in terminal/command line
Great for beginners learning Python and logic with loops

🛠️ How It Works
The script asks the user for the desired password length.
It then loops through and randomly selects characters from a defined set of:
Uppercase letters (A-Z)
Digits (0-9)
Special characters (!, @, #, etc.)
It generates the password by combining those characters using a for loop.
